# Generative Models for Social Media Analytics: Networks, Text, and Time
ICWSM 2018 Tutorial

Monday, June 25: 1:30pm - 5:30pm

## Abstract

Traditional social network models aim to understand social phenomena by studying graphs which represent the connections between individuals. In the age of social media, in which many of our social interactions are recorded digitally, social network data have become much richer and more complex. It has become increasingly clear that our models need to go beyond a single network, to include aspects such as textual and temporal information, and to handle data with multiple relations. Generative probabilistic models are well suited for such analyses of social media data, as they provide a natural framework for reasoning collectively over multiple data modalities.

This tutorial presents recent advances in generative models for social media analytics, focusing on models that encode social phenomena with latent (i.e. hidden) attributes, which are subsequently recovered from data. The tutorial begins with a review of generative models for social networks, including latent space models, block models, and modern variants of these such as mixed membership models. The second part of the tutorial showcases richer models for social media data that include text and dynamics, alongside illustrative case studies. The tutorial aims to serve a multidisciplinary audience, including scholars from both the social and computational sciences.

Kevin S. Xu is an assistant professor in the EECS Department at the University of Toledo. His main research interests are in machine learning and statistical signal processing with applications to network science and human dynamics. He received his PhD in 2012 from the University of Michigan.

James R. Foulds (Jimmy) is an assistant professor in the Department of Information Systems at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. His research interests are in machine learning, focusing on probabilistic latent variable models and the inference algorithms to learn them from social networks and text data.
